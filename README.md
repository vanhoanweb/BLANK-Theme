# What is BLANK?

It is a WordPress theme with all the functionality of a typical WordPress theme but almost none of the styling. The idea is that when starting a new theme, it is far easier to use this as a base then a theme that is already finished and styled.

## Features

* Things are as semantically marked up as can be for a starter theme.
* It's HTML5.
* The sidebar is widget-ready.
* Page titles are optimized for best SEO and readability/usability.
* Functions.php file provides some cool extra features.
* Has some starter CSS ready to go, more about that below.
* Uses `includes` for some key things, like under-title meta data and forward/back navigation, that are very common places for redundant code in themes.

## About the CSS

As you can see from the screenshot above, the CSS is pretty barren, but not entirely! Here are some things the CSS is set up for:

* Includes a .group selector for the new clearfix
* Has basic toolbox and WordPress-standard CSS classes.
* Includes standard typography-related selectors.
* CSS for threaded comments is in there, but light on actual styling.
* Both screen and print styles included in single stylesheet. Print styles optimized for generic nice printing.
